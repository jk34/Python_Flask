I created a web application using Flask. It is based on this tutorial: pythonprogramming.net

This application lets the user signup and register with their username, email, and password. Then, the user can log in or log out. There are also links to my Github and Linkedin pages at the top bar of the webpage. Clicking on the "Interactive" link lets the user guess my name and enter the value.
